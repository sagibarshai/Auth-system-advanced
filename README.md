# Robust Auth System with Database, Refresh Tokens and Cookie-Based JWT Authentication

This project provides a secure and well-structured Node.js Express TypeScript application for user authentication with email verification, refresh tokens, and cookie-based JWT authentication. It's designed to be a solid foundation for building new projects with robust authentication features.

**Key Features:**

---

**User Authentication:**

Signup with email and password

Signin with email and password

Signout (invalidate token and cookie)

Email verification for account activation

Resend email verification with configurable retry limits

---

**Security:**

Strong password hashing

Email verification for increased security

Refresh tokens for long-lived sessions

Cookie-based JWT authentication for secure token storage

Session management with secure secret

---

**Middleware:**

currentUser: Retrieves the currently logged-in user (if any)

requireAuth: Protects routes that require authentication

notFoundRoute: Handles requests for non-existent routes

errorHandler: Provides centralized error handling

---

**Structure:**

Clean and organized codebase using TypeScript

Modular design for easier maintenance

Environment variables for sensitive data (*.env)

---

**Database:**

Uses PostgreSQL for user and verification data (two tables: users and emailVerification)

Secure connection and data management

---

**Dockerization:**

Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml included for easy deployment

Facilitates local development and containerized environments

---


# Getting Started:
Prerequisites
Docker, Git

This guide provides two options for setting up the environment variables and running the project. Choose the option that best fits your needs.

# Option 1: Single .env File in the Backend Folder

1. **Clone the Repository**

**git clone https://github.com/sagibarshai/Auth-System.git**

**cd Auth-System**

2. **Create the .env File**
   
Inside the backend folder, create a file named .env to hold the environment variables for configuration and database settings.

File Location: backend/.env

Contents of the .env file:

General Configuration:

PORT=value

JWT_KEY=value

COOKIE_SECRET=value

EMAIL_ADDRESS=value

EMAIL_ACCESS_KEY=value

Database Configuration:

POSTGRES_USER=value

POSTGRES_PASSWORD=value

POSTGRES_DATABASE=value

POSTGRES_PORT=value

POSTGRES_DB=value

POSTGRES_HOST=value

Optional Settings:

JWT_EXPIRED_IN=value

COOKIES_EXPIRED_IN=value

Replace value with your actual values for each configuration.

3. **Running the Project**
   
Run the following command to build and start the project using Docker Compose. It will automatically use the environment variables defined in the .env file located in the backend directory.

**docker-compose --env-file ./backend/.env up --build**

4. **Stopping the Project**

To stop the project, run:

**docker-compose down**


# Option 2: Two .env Files (One in the Backend Folder and One in the Root Directory)

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
**git clone https://github.com/sagibarshai/Auth-System.git**

**cd Auth-System**

2. **Create Two .env Files**

Backend .env file (located in backend/.env)

Contents of the .env file:

General Configuration:

PORT=value

JWT_KEY=value

COOKIE_SECRET=value

EMAIL_ADDRESS=value

EMAIL_ACCESS_KEY=value

Database Configuration:

POSTGRES_USER=value

POSTGRES_PASSWORD=value

POSTGRES_DATABASE=value

POSTGRES_PORT=value

POSTGRES_DB=value

POSTGRES_HOST=value

Optional Settings:

JWT_EXPIRED_IN=value

COOKIES_EXPIRED_IN=value

Root .env file (located in the project root folder)

Contents of the .env file:

Database Configuration (matching with backend/.env):

POSTGRES_USER=value

POSTGRES_PASSWORD=value

POSTGRES_DATABASE=value

POSTGRES_PORT=value

Replace value with your actual values for each configuration.

3. **Running the Project:**
   
To start the project with Docker Compose, run the following command:

**docker-compose up --build**

This will build the services and start them using the environment variables defined in both .env filesâ€”one in the root directory and one in the backend directory.

4. **Stopping the Project**

To stop the project, run:

**docker-compose down**
